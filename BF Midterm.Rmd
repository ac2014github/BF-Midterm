# beta is 1, indicating that the model fully incorporates the most recent information about the trend into its calculations, making it highly sensitive to changes.

#Gamma is 0.9574355, meaning it gives about 95.74% of the weight to the most recent seasonal values when updating the seasonal component. This value indicates that the model is very responsive to changes in seasonal patterns.

The initial trend is -412.9180, indicating that the initial point is decreasing at a rate of about 412.92 unites per time period. The initial states for the seasonal component of 410.2043 indicates that the month has a positive deviation of 410.2043, meaning above-average performance.

# The naive forecasting method uses the previous dataset values to forecast. It is typically used as a benchmark for the other forecasting methods

#The moving average method averages a set of data points over a specified number of periods to smooth out fluctuations and highlight trends and is useful for short-term forecasting where the datapoints are fairly consistent

# The simple smoothing method applies a constant smoothing factor (alpha) to past observations to create a weighted average, where more recent observations are given more weight. It is particularly useful for data without a trend or seasonality.

# The holts winters method extends simple exponential smoothing to capture both trends and seasonality. It is effective for forecasting a time series data with both trend and seasonal patterns.

#

# Over the time period, there was a gradual incline in sales with clear seasonality 2022 onward. I think that in the next year, the data will slightly increase following the data and will do the same the next 2 years taking seasonality into account. 

# Ranking: 1. Holts winters
# 2. Moving Average
# 3. Simple Smoothing
# 4. Naive
